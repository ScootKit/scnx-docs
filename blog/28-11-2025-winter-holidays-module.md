# 🧑‍🎄 December is around the corner: Use our new module to make your Discord server stand out with an advent calendar

Hey there,

the holidays are just around the corner! Christmas is coming up, so it's time to prepare an event for your Discord – and it's super easy with SCNX!

## 📅 December starts soon

December starts soon - and with it, many people will open a door every day until Christmas again. This increases the anticipation for Christmas and sweetens the day for many people.
This year, you too can offer your members a virtual advent calendar - filled by you! Users can only open one door per day, which is why they keep coming back to your server.
This ensures an exciting and fun time for your community, while your server becomes more active at the same time.

## 🔎 The virtual advent calendar with SCNX

Are you looking for an exciting and interactive way to offer your community a unique event this December? Then we can only recommend hosting an advent calendar for your community with our brand new **"Winter Holidays" module on SCNX**!

The module allows you to send 24 doors in a channel of your choice. From December 1st to December 24th, members can open today's door every day and find a message designed by you, optionally with a role of your choice. You can hide really anything behind the doors - more on that later.

## 🛠️ How it works

:::tip Not with SCNX yet?
SCNX is a service where you can create a completely customizable Discord bot for your server without any programming. You can follow [these easy instructions](/docs/setup) to get started right away.
:::

* **Configure the module:** You define some basic settings and determine what awaits users behind the doors. The module is very easy to understand - should you still have problems, our [excellent customer support](https://scnx.app/help) is happy to help.
* **Your community opens the respective door every day:** Users can interactively open today's door in your advent calendar channel every day. Only then do they receive the message customized by you and possibly more, such as a role.
* **The interactive advent calendar updates automatically:** Your advent calendar updates automatically every hour - including the current date and other exciting info, e.g. how many users are participating in the advent calendar.


## ❓ Why is a virtual advent calendar a good idea for my community?

With a virtual advent calendar, you make your server stand out from the crowd while offering your community an exciting event. During this event, users come back to your server every day, so you can expect higher activity. It is also extremely easy to use and create for both your community and you, even though you can customize almost anything.

## 💡 Tips for an even better event
Further tips and tricks, which also go into more detail on the concrete implementation on your server, can be found in our scnx.tips article.
