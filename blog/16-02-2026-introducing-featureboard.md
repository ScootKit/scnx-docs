Hey everyone,

We have some massive news to share today. If you've been part of the SCNX community for a while, you know that we thrive on your feedback. Whether it's a suggestion for a new module, a tweak to the leveling system, or a crazy idea — your input builds this platform.

But as our community has grown, keeping track of all those brilliant ideas has become a challenge. We realized we needed a better system. We needed a way to make feedback transparent, organized, and truly democratic.

**Today, we are proud to launch Featureboard — a community-driven feedback platform that uses AI to provide you with a better experience and give us a clearer overview of new features.**

## Why we built Featureboard

For a long time, user feedback was a bit of a "black box." You would submit an idea, and maybe you'd hear back, or maybe it would end up on a long internal to-do list. We wanted to change that.

Featureboard was built to solve three main problems:

1.  **Transparency:** We want you to see exactly what other users are suggesting and what our team is thinking.
2.  **Prioritization:** We can't build everything at once. Featureboard lets the community vote, so the most important features rise to the top naturally.
3.  **Communication:** You deserve to know when an idea is planned, in progress, or shipped.

### More Efficiency, More Features

While Featureboard creates a much better experience for you, it is also a game-changer for our team. It allows us to keep track of suggestions effortlessly and get a clear view of what is most important to our community. Because of the new AI features, maintenance is very easy — tasks like moderation are **completely automated**. This means we spend less time sorting tickets and more time building the features you want.

## How it Works: Ride the Wave

Using Featureboard is simple, but powerful. It puts the control in your hands.

**1. Share Your Idea**
Got a vision for SCNX? [Submit a suggestion](https://featureboard.net/submit). It could be a new feature, an improvement, or even a completely new product direction. You can write your suggestion in multiple languages: FeatureBoard translates it automatically, and our AI-powered system even helps categorize it for us.

**2. Processing**
This is where the magic happens. [Browse the feed](https://featureboard.net/browse) to see what others are suggesting. If you see an idea you love, give it an upvote. Featureboard calculates metrics like the **Popularity Score** and the **Implementation Likelihood** live, keeping the community updated in real-time.

**3. We Build It**
We use top-voted suggestions to guide our roadmap. While a high upvote count doesn't automatically guarantee implementation — we still have to consider technical feasibility and our overall product vision — it is the absolute best way to show our team what you want to see next.

## Full Visibility with the Public Roadmap

One of our favorite parts of Featureboard is the [**Open Roadmap**](https://featureboard.net/roadmap).

Instead of wondering if a feature is coming "soon," you can check the roadmap to see the real-time status. You can see what's **In Progress**, what's **Planned** for the near future, and what's currently in the **Backlog** for the community to vote on.

This level of transparency means no surprises. You drive the decisions, and you can watch as your feedback turns into real features on SCNX.

## Supporting Development & Priority Suggestions

### Memberships

Featureboard is free for everyone to browse and submit. However, building and maintaining high-quality software takes resources. To help us continue offering fair prices and cool features, a [ScootKit Membership Level 3](https://membership.scootkit.com/de) gives you **Prioritized Suggestions** for faster review, priority placement, and doubles your daily upvote limit from 5 to 10. You also get priority support on our Discord.

### Sponsor a Feature: Fast-Track Your Vision

Sometimes, you need a feature *now*, and you don't want to wait for it to climb the voting ranks.

We are introducing a new **"Sponsor a Feature"** option. This is for power users or businesses who want to guarantee that a specific feature gets built. When you sponsor a feature, you get:

* **Guaranteed Implementation:** Your feature gets a dedicated development slot.
* **Direct Access:** You'll be in direct communication with the dev team during the build.
* **Branding:** Your name or logo will be displayed as the sponsor on the roadmap and release notes.

It's a win-win: you get the tool you need, and the whole community benefits from the new feature. [Learn more about Sponsoring](https://featureboard.net/sponsored).

## One More Thing... Featureboard for Everyone

We built Featureboard because we needed it for SCNX. But as we built it, we realized that other communities need this too.

If you run your own SaaS, Discord community, or software project, **you can use Featureboard too.** We are offering a white-label version that is fully branded to your project, endlessly customizable, and AI-powered.

If you are interested in launching your own feedback platform, we would love for you to [get in touch with us](https://featureboard.net/for-companies).

## Start Voting Today

We are incredibly excited to open this up to you. The roadmap is already filling up, and there are some great suggestions waiting for your vote.
