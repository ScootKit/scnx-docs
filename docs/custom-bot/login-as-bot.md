# Log-In as Bot

Send messages, giveaways, and polls with your bot!

## Features {#features}

- Send messages with embeds, self role elements, pictures and much more.
- Start a giveaway for your server (not supported yet).

## Usage {#usage}

First, visit the [Bot-Log-in page](https://scnx.app/glink?page=bot/login) in your dashboard.
It should look like this:

![This is the Bot-Log-in page in your dashboard.](@site/docs/assets/custom-bot/additional-features/login-as-bot-001.png)

Here you can take several actions - they are explained in more detail below.

## Send a message

Select the channel on the left side where you want to send the message, then click on the ‘Send message’ button to send a new message.
You are now in the message editor, where you can customize your message as you wish (as with almost all message editors in SCNX).

You can find a detailed description for all the features of the message editor [here](#message-editor).

Once you are done, send your message and the bot will send it to your selected channel.

### Edit the message text

To edit the ‘normal’ message text, click in the message field and edit your text.
You can mention channels and roles using the ``@`` symbol (or use the Discord format instead), the emoji symbol opens the emoji selection, and the button on the right takes you to the [Discord Formatting](https://docs.scnx.xyz/docs/discord-formatting/) documentation page.

:::info Mention users/roles/channels using the Discord format
If you want to mention users, roles, or channels manually, you can do this (in addition to the SCNX UI) using the Discord format - you can find all the information about that in [this article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/ articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID) from Discord.
