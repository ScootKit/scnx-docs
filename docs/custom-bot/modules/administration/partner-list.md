<ModuleOverview moduleName="partner-list" />

This module is designed to make managing partnerships with other Discord servers easy.

* Create an always up-to-date embed listing all your current partners.
* Create custom categories to keep your partners sorted.
* Automatically assign and remove roles from partners.
* Automatically send notifications to your partner about changes in their status.

## Setup {#setup}

* Please [set up permissions](/docs/custom-bot/slash-commands) for Slash-Commands to avoid unauthorized usage of them.
* Then, configure the partner-list:
    1. Create a channel in which the bot should send the partner-list. The bot has
       to have the "View channel", "View message history" and "Send message" permissions on it.
    2. Open the [Module configuration](https://scnx.app/glink?page=bot/configuration?file=partner-list%7Cconfig)
       and [configure the module](#configuration).
    3. Reload the configuration of your bot to apply changes - the bot will send a partner-list automatically.

## Usage {#usage}

* To add a new partner, use [`/partner add`](#commands).
* To edit a partner, use [`/partner edit`](#commands).
* To delete a partner, use [`/partner delete`](#commands).
* The Partner-List will be updated automatically to reflect changes, no manual action needed.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

<details>
    <summary>The Partner-List is not appearing in the configured channel or not updating correctly.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure bot has "View channel", "Send messages" and "View message history" permissions on the channel.</li>
        <li>Make sure non of your category fields are empty.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the message is no longer than 1024 characters.</li>
        <li>Restart your bot.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I restart the ID counter?</summary>

    No. The ID is an unique identification number and can not be reset. This is a technical limitation - you can remove the <code>%id%</code> parameter from your "partner-string" under "Partner-List-Embed" in your <a href="https://scnx.app/glink?page=bot/configuration?file=partner-list%7Cconfig">module configuration</a> or replace it with the <code>%nr%</code> parameter, which automatically updates the numbers.

## Stored data {#data-usage}

The following data is being stored about every partner created via [commands](#commands):

* An unique integer identifying the database entry
* The Invite-Link specified for this partner
* The User-ID of the staff-member creating the partner entry
* The specified name of the partner
* The specified category of the partner
* Metadata about the entry (date when created and last updated)

To delete stored data, use [`/partner delete`](#commands)
or [purge the module database](/docs/custom-bot/additional-features#reset-module-database).
